# weatherApplication

This is an interactive weather application, with a visually appealing UI. Using the Open Wather Map API, this weather application functions in a user's browser and enables a user to:

1. Enter a city name and see the current weather and five-day forecast of that input upon clicking the submit button or pressing enter.
2. The user input is then added to the search-history.
3. The user can click on a city from search-history and the current weather and five-day forecast are displayed.
4. The current weather will display the city name, date, weather-icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index.
5. The UV index will change color display depending on severity.
6. The five-day forecast displays the date, weather-icon, temperature, and humidity for each day.
