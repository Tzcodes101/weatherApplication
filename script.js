        //this input value is then added to search history and displayed to page


    //add click event to buttons in search history so that user can click on the button and get the present and future forecast for the corresponding city (this).val() maybe...?
        //so when I click on a history button, then I get present and future forecast
            //can I do this by somehow setting the button content equal to the input value from the search box, then calling initial function
            //or just create new function using same initial code but different input var, however, it grabs the search-history-button value that was clicked, instead of the value from the search-for-city input.
